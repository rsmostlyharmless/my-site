Working through the Complete Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy by Dr. Angela Yu - This is the start of intermediate CSS.

This is the start of what will be my online cv. Although I followed a Web Development course I have made my own changes and will continue to make other changes such as colour and images. Though I want to continue using the spaceman images as I really like them.

Astronaut images were created by an artist named Catalyststuff and downloaded from freepik.com

The prfile image is a painting my girlfriend did for me. It's me as an octopus which came about after she watched My Octopus Teacher on Netflix. I have now adopted it as my avatar.
